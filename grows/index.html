    <p>I started making research on working enviroments with multiple roles interacting. I find out feedback was a fundamental part of the individual learning process or for the development of a product, but there was no specialized feedback tool.</p>
    <p>A usefull feebback would be the one that help the person that gives it and recieve it improve over time. I design a Web App specialized for give feedback based on the "Glows" and "Grows" structure. There's no growt in confort, recieving actionable and constructive criticism.</p>

    <h1>☘ UX Process</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Task</h2>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>You are working for a new startup that is looking to launch a software as a service (SaaS) desktop web app for companies to use internally. You will be researching the market and meeting with employees to determine the needs of the business and then developing an MVP based upon your findings.</p>
        <p>Thus far, we have been designing for customers as the end user, but now you have to consider multiple kinds of users: Businesses that make the purchasing decisions, so you will need to convince them that this is a valuable servics. Employees at the company who will actually be using the service.</p>
        <p>Individual Project / 5 days</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Generative Research</h2>
      <p>For this task, we will have to develop a Web App, to be used within a company. So the first step, was to go to the working spaces that have multiple roles interacting and observe how pieces work together. The goal of this first fase was to detect problems, frustrations and pain points, so that I develop a product that is needed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Research Planning</h2>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>What do I want to find out?</h3>
        <p>● What tools (web apps, SaaS) they use for work on daily bases?</p>
        <p>● What are the most important -crucial- tools, that make their work happen?</p>
        <p>● Is there a tool they use because the works needed, but they don’t like it
        Is there something missing?</p>
        <p>● How they adapt to resolve things?</p>
        <p>● What is the workflow?</p>
        <h3>From who?</h3>
        <p>In a stablished organization of any size, in a startup team,</p>
        <h3>How to reach them?</h3>
        <p>I will arrange 6 user interviews with team admin (1), project director (2), company CTO (1) and employee (2). The interviews will have place in their working enviroment.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Project Planning</h2>
      <h3>⌛ How much time I will have?</h3>
      <p>5 days. For this project I prioritize the UX research process, because I have very limited time, this would imply I won’t dedicate so much time into visual side of the final product. I will try to keep the visual side very simple, in order to dedicate more time to apply the process I was learning in this bootcamp.</p>
      <p>I make a list of task using kanvan method, this is how it look at the middle of the process:</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Naturalistic Observation</h2>
      <p>In the meantime I look around the classroom and I observe we have a board to give feedback. I start thinking in my closer enviroment.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/images/grows/board-1.jpg" />
        <figcaption>Feedback boards</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For example, at Ironhack we have the students, the teacher, the Team Administrators, the Program Manager and the Director. We are all giving feedback to each other daily or biweekly.</p>
      <p>And we also have a google docs file for each project where we give and recieve feedback. I notice we were giving feedback on a google docs file, but writing in column/rows is not great.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/images/grows/feedback-example.png" />
        <figcaption>This was the format we were using to give feedback.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>User Interviews</h2>
      <p>I start my proces interviewing people in their working enviroment, asking them about their prevoiuos experience with feedback.</p>
      <div class="quote">
        <h3>Key insights</h3>
        <p>➞ No transparency, Who is going to read my feedback?.</p>
        <p>➞ HR / time trackers are like police "a nigtmare" for employees.</p>
        <p>➞ They all want to save meaningfull feedback.</p>
        <p>➞ They all consider their prevoious experience with feedback/tutorship/mentoring have change the way they work postively.</p>
        <p>➞ If there's no room for feedback working enviroment can become "toxic".</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Usability Test</h2>
        <p>When I was interviewing managers, I've also ask them show me the files they were managing on daily bases and I observe how they use them.</p>

        <p>➞ Eternal horizontal scrolling for searching.</p>
        <p>➞ Not ideal way of inputing text, the way is written is in lillte rows or boxes.</p>
        <p>➞ Lot's of <b>manual work</b> is required from the staff to organize feedback.</p>
        <p>➞ Bad search engine and filtering of information.</p>
        <p>➞ Google Suite is the most use because of the saring in groups feature.</p>
        <p>➞ No way to see visualize progress over time</p>
