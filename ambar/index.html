          <h3>Task</h3>
        </header>
        <p>You will have two weeks to build a digital product based on your own vision, research, findings and the UX/UI process you’ve learned throughout the program. You can create either an App or a responsive website. You need to identify a problem that perhaps you or someone you know are facing every day. Choose something you would love to work on, because you already know the topic or because you are genuinely curious about it.</p>
        <p>Individual Project / 11 days</p>

      <h2>Generative Research</h2>
    </header>
    <p>For this task I needed to pick up a topic, and I spent the hole first day trying to pick one, but left the class without having a topic. Comming back home in the metro, I listen to a women speaking (with southamerican accent), she said somthing like <em>"I don't have nothing here, but I feel much safer"</em>. Then it came to me the idea to work around violence and women from latinamerica.</p>
    <p>By picking up such a complex and broad topic I was well aware of my personal bias being a mexican women, but even If I knew from experience how this context can be for women, I needed to confirm this with research.
  </section>

    <header>
      <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
    </header>
    <p>The violence have been increasing in the past years in Mexico. All the country population is affected by “violent waves”, and one of the most affected segments of population are women. Life keep going on despite the situation, and womens face alert states, either constantly or in specific moments: walking on their own, during the night, while transporting or passing by solitary zones.</p>
    <p>It's sad for me to say that Mexico has one of the higest rates on feminicides in the world. Having this as a historical background, the general fear in mexican womens goes beyond sexual harassment, in many levels they are fearing for the integrity of their life. In a context where you cannot rely on the state to protect their citizens, emergency states are resolved by familly and close friends.</p>

      <h2>Research Planning</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I've started my project making cuestions. Then I choose the methodologies that would help me answering or getting more information about them.</p>
    <p>It was also my final project so it was very important for me to have an rich UX process. Defining my cuestions for start, would guide me gathering data, and having great data will help me taking inform desitions during the design process.</p>
    <div class="padding-left">
      <header>
        <h3>What do I want to find out?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>- Do they feel in danger?, Is this actually a real problem for them? </p>
      <p>- What are they fearing to happen?, what sort of danger we are speaking about?</p>
      <p>- When do they feel in danger?, when it becames a problem? during the day, at night, all times?</p>
      <p>- When feeling in danger, what's the first thing they do?, Are they looking for an strategical or physical solution?</p>
      <p>- What precautions thet are they currently taking? (focus on existing behaviors!)</p>
      <p>- Until what level they rely on their social network for protection? Which are the existing channels of protection?</p>
      <p>- Who would they trust?, who would they contact first?</p>
      <p>- What tools of communication are you used to use? (this will also help me knowing their native enviroment regarding apps, when they use apps and for what they use them)</p>
      <header>
        <h3>From who?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>My target audience would be mexican women, but I know that lots of women from many other countries (unfortunally) will also identify with the problem, so I would be open to explore other audience, even if my focus is in Mexican Women.</p>
      <header>
        <h3>How I would reach them?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>Since Im living in Barcelona and my target audience is in another continent, I would use the internet, my personal facebook account, watsapp and skype.</p>
      <header>
        <h3>How much time do I have?</h3>

      <h2>User Interviews</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I started my research process with 5 user interviews in order to gather cualitative data. I needed to sense how mexican women releate to states of danges.</p><p>My promt was:</p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p></p>
        <p>Have you ever feel in danger?...</p>
        <p>Would you like to share with me<br>more about it?</p>
      </div>
    <p>This was like oppening the Pandora Box, and they all have something to say about this topic.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <header>
        <h3>Key insights</h3>
      </header>
      <p>➞ They all mention "network" and "groups" of protection.</p>
      <p>➞ They all consider this have been a mayor problem on their daily lives.</p>
      <p>➞ They never think about it until something had happened, a violent event (regardless the gravity) can permanently trastocate their personal notion of safety.</p>
      <p>➞ They mention age, being young women makes you more expose.</p>

      <h2>Online Survey</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I decided to run an online survey in order to gather cuantitavive data and reach a broader group of mexican women. I write a 17 cuestions survey focus on detecting <em>existing behaviors</em>.</p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>Very high level of response<br>245 persons took the survey</p>

        <h3>Key insights</h3>
      </header>
      <p>➞ They inform other people where they are as a precautory meassure.</p>
      <p>➞ They first contact a person they trust (low level of reliability on authorities)</p>
      <p>➞ Subjectve wellbeing is determinate by states of violence, they often feel fear despite having concrete reasons, ongoing states of alert.</p>
      <p>➞ They look for strategic solutions to problems. Wich means an app can help providing strategic steps.</p>
      <p>➞ Large number of women have been victims of physical violence at some point in their lives.</p>
      <p>➞ If they know some one is in trouble, they all would like to help if they can, (only 6 persons out of 245 said "each person can take care of themselves")</p>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>The close social network is the one taking care of the states of alert. Mutual care is fundamental to keep safe in a violent context.</p>

      <img width="70%" src="/images/ambar/user-flow.jpg" />
      <p>I itinerate between the user flow and the paper prototype, because they help defining each other. Often I had to modify the flow after doing some paper screens, because I realised I was missing some steps, and the other way around.</p>
      <img width="70%" src="/images/ambar/paper-prototype.jpg" />
      <p>For the paper prototype I find it usefull to use pencil so that I can be making small changes to the prototype after testing, and continue to testing imidiatelly (without having to draw the hole screen again).</p>

    <p>☞ Trust the method!</p>
    <p>☞ Having the Affinty Diagram close to you in the process, helps keeping in mind <em>who</em> you are doing this for and <em>why</em> they need it.</p>
    <p>☞ Know your goal and get there following little steps in the correct direction.</p>
    <p>☞ How to use UX hemathy methodologies to present your users to others.</p>
    <p>☞ Making visuals to present your research, prevents "research" staying as an abstract part of the design process.</p>
    <p>☞ Details are important, but is better done than perfect (really!).</p>
    <p>☞ I need to keep better evidence of my design itinerarions.</p>
