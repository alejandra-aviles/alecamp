      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Idealista is the most use site in Spain for searching houses. At the moment only support individual searching. Is needed a group search so groups can share their search and be feeding the same favorite list.</p>
      <p>For implement the changes I had to respect the current design and UI elements of the app. I started my process making observations of the current app of idealista, then I made Research planning and Project Planning. The main contact with users was trought user interviews (4) with persons that are currently searching a house, I also ask them to use the app and observe how they did it.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Research Planning</h2>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>What do I want to find out?</h3>

        <br>Method: My observations and notes</p>
        <p>● How people currently use the website and the app?
        <br>Method: Usability test</p>
        <p>● Why stakeholders would find it a valuable feature to add.
        <br>Method: persona, problem statement</p>
        <p>● If people prefer to use mobile, desktop or both, when searching house
        <br>Method: User interviews</p>
        <p>● In what scenario they would need to use the feature.
        <br>Method: Scenarios</p>
        <p>● Are there are other apps that offer this feature and how they do it
        <br>Method: Benchmarking / Competitive analysis</p>

      <h2>User Interviews</h2>
      <p><em>In what scenario users would need a group search feature?</em></p>
      <p>I made 4 user interviews. I went to the houses of this persons and speak with them in the middle of their process of moving appartment. I wanted to sense when they would need a group feature, I also was open to listen to their complaints and observe what other apps they were using to finding a house.</p>

<!-- Draft -->
<!-- <p>During the interview I notice Valentina had a long scroll page to admin all her favorites. She told me she have marked more than 40 favorite houses but at the moment there's no a way to organize her favorites into groups. I asked her to write the groups she would be ordering her list of favorites in case she can make groups of favorites.</p>
<img width="30%" src="/images/add-a-feature/valentina-groups.png" />
<p>This are the groups Valentina would idealy make, and later on I consider this in the prototype.</p> -->
