      <h3>Task</h3>
    </header>
    <p>You will be developing a new feature for an existing app based on an area of functionality to explore. Your work will culminate in a high-fidelity prototype that reflects your best path forward based on research, iteration, and testing. For apps that have both Android and iOS implementations, you may choose either platform.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
    </header>
    <p>As part of the UX/UI Bootcamp at Ironhack I was asked to add a shared search feature in the current app of idealista. I had to respect tu current design and UI elements while implementing the feature. Idealista is the main site in Spain for searching houses. At the moment is only supporting individual search. Is needed a group search so different persons can share their search and access to the same favorite list.</p>

    <p>I started my process making my first observations of the current app of idealista, then I made Research planning and Project Planning. Then I made some recorded usability test. The main contact with users was trought user interviews (4) with persons that are currently searching a house.</p>

      <h2>User Interviews</h2>
    </header>
    <p><em>In what scenario users would need a group search feature?</em></p>
    <p>I made 4 user interviews. I went to the houses of this persons and speak with them in the middle of their process of moving appartment. I wanted to sense when they would need a group feature, I also was open to listen to their complaints and observe what other apps they were using to finding a house.</p>

        <p><b>Valentina</b> is in an stable relation with <b>Carlos</b>, so they decided to finally move together. During the interview I notice Valentina had a long scroll page to admin all her favorites. She told me she have marked more than 40 favorite houses but at the moment there's no way to organize her favorites into groups. She would love to have a syncronize list of favorites with Carlos.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p><b>Hans</b> and <b>Juan</b> are living together as a couple. In the past, they found a good deal in a flat close to the Ramblas, but now they have double up the rent. The owner give them a deadline, before the new price is apply. They are now in the urgency, but they have different working schedules wich make it more complicated to organize.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <p><b>Paco</b>, <b>Patricio</b> and <b>Marcos</b>, were looking for a Warehouse in Hospitalet to rent studios for artists. The search was under the account of Paco. When they see each other, they share and comment the favorites. Paco share options to the other guys using whatsapp. Paco found out he had to do most of the work, having all the info in his account made him more responsible of the search than the others.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p><b>Diego</b> is looking for an apartment because two of his best friends <b>Alex</b> and <b>Fede</b> are moving to Barcelona (from Madrid and Miami).
